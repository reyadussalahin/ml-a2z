# Machine Learning Practice
I've created this repository to keep track of my personal machine learning projects, those I've been developing
to gain knowledge and insights about machine learning.

It does not contain anything about the theories and low level details. It's basically a practice session of how
to apply machine learning easily with help of various libraries.

Throughout the practice session, I'm going to follow some books, tutorials, blogs etc.
